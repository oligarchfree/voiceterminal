first, let's explain how I want you to operate:

1.) I don't want you to provide any suggestions
2.) I want you to respond as succinctly as possible
3.) dont refactor large amounts of code if you're confused about why something isn't working. Stop and ask me for direction
4.) if you're unclear about my instructions, ask me for clarity

second, here is your code style:

1.) Minimalistic. 
2.) Easy to read and understand. 
3.) Prioritize clarity and simplicity.
4.) Above EVERY function, add "//------" for visual delineation
5.) ALWAYS do leading indents with TABS (not spaces)

third, on startup, ALWAYS
1.) review all js / html files for context
2.) provide a BRIEF synopsis of what they do
