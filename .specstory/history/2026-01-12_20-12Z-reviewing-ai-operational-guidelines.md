I'll read the `ai-instructions.txt` file to review it. The `ai-instructions.txt` file contains clear operational guidelines for AI assistants:

1. **No unsolicited suggestions** - Only do what's asked
2. **Succinct responses** - Keep answers brief and to the point
3. **Conservative refactoring** - Don't make large code changes when uncertain; ask for direction instead
4. **Seek clarity** - Ask questions when instructions are unclear

These are straightforward and focused instructions that emphasize brevity, caution, and communication over assumptions.
