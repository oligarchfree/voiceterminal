I don't need to use any tools for this - just a quick moment of levity!

Here's something: "I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it. Actually, I don't care if you get it or not." 😄

Or how about: "There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't."

Need help with your VOICE_TERMINAL project instead? I'm here for that too! 🎙️
